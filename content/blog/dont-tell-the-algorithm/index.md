Hello! My name is Dennis, also known as **DDob**, and this is my personal website. I have been wanting a place where all of my work can live together, from my music and blog posts to the many (technical) projects I am working on. Until now, everything has been scattered across the internet, which never felt right. This is where I start bringing it all home.

## Why I am building my own space

So much of the internet today is controlled by a handful of large platforms. They decide what is visible, what gets hidden, and what stays online. My creative work should not depend on algorithm changes or business decisions that I have no say in.

I want full control over my creations and how they are presented. I want a home where everything stays online as long as I want it to, and where I can experiment freely without asking for permission.

This website is my own corner of the internet. No ads. No dark patterns. Just my work, in one place.

## What comes next

This is just the beginning, and there is still a lot missing. Over the next few weeks, I will work on bringing all of my music here as well.

If you would like to learn more about me, check out the [About](@/about.md) page.
