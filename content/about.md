# About Me

Hey! I’m Dennis, also known as **DDob**. Music has always been my biggest passion, and it’s what led me deep into the world of technology. I love digging into complex systems, peeling back the layers, and turning challenges into elegant solutions. When I’m not coding or experimenting with new technologies, you’ll probably find me producing music or exploring ideas at the intersection of both worlds.

I occasionally teach as well — sharing knowledge and helping others level up is something I truly enjoy.

Below is a look at the path I’ve taken so far:

Contributing to the Qt framework, delivering stable, cross-platform libraries and applications with long-term API compatibility. [Patch contributions](https://codereview.qt-project.org/q/owner:dennis.oberst@qt.io)

* Maintainer of the [Qt GRPC](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtgrpc-index.html) module, a high-performance RPC framework for Qt, leading development and ensuring stability, scalability, and API consistency.
* Designed and implemented cross-platform, binary-compatible public APIs used by millions of developers.
* Developed and maintained production-quality examples and comprehensive documentation, including [QtGrpcChat](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtgrpc-chat-example.html) and [Filesystem Explorer](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/tutorials/extendedexplorer/extendedexplorer.html), to demonstrate best practices, guide developers, and facilitate adoption of Qt modules.
* Profiled, benchmarked, and optimized core components, improving performance of key classes such as [QString](https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/494280). Shared insights and best practices at [Qt World Summit 2025](https://github.com/deeedob/qtws25)

{% titem(date="2024/09", end="2025/02", title="Guest Lecturer", institution="Cologne University of Applied Sciences") %}

Co-developed the course **“Engineering Desktop Applications with C++ and Qt”** for the Wintersemester 24/25 together with Ursula Derichs and Prof. Dr. Jan Salmen. Students built a full-featured audio player as their semester project in Qt. Results highlighted in the [Qt blog](https://www.qt.io/blog/from-classroom-to-code-innovative-qt-apps-by-future-developers).

* Created structured materials and demos focused on modern C++ practices and professional UI development.
* Guided ~40 students in weekly sessions, supporting their practical software engineering and design skills.
